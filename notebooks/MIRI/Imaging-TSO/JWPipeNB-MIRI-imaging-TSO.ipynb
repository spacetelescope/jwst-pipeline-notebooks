    "**Purpose**:<br>\n",
    "This notebook provides a framework for processing generic Mid-Infrared Instrument \n",
    "(MIRI) Imaging time series observations (TSO) data through all\n",
    "three James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) pipeline stages.  The data are assumed\n",
    "to be located in the observation directory located in the path set up below.\n",
    "It should not be necessary to edit any cells other than in the\n",
    "[Configuration](#1.-Configuration) section unless modifying the standard\n",
    "pipeline processing options.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant portion of the data processing workflow for Imaging TSOs is identical to the methods used to process (non-TSO) Imaging observations, and much of this notebook mirrors the corresponding steps shown in the general MIRI Imaging notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**:<br>\n",
    "This example is set up to use observations of a secondary eclipse event of LHS-1478b, which were obtained as part of Cycle 1 General Observers Proposal ID (PID) 3730 Observation 13 (PI: H. Diamond-Lowe). A continuous series of 964 integrations of the target was collected with the F1500W filter. No dithering was carried out, as is standard practice for Imaging TSOs. The SUB256 subarray readout was used. The example uncalibrated data will be downloaded automatically unless disabled (i.e., to run with user-supplied local files instead).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Imaging TSO programs do not have dedicated background observations, with background flux subtraction handled using pixels near the target in the science observations. This version of the notebook does not accommodate cases where dedicated background subtraction is needed. Consult the general MIRI Imaging notebook for a detailed implementation of dedicated background exposures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JWST pipeline version and CRDS context**:<br>\n",
    "This notebook was written for the above-specified pipeline version and associated build context for this version of the JWST Calibration Pipeline. Information about this and other contexts can be found in the JWST Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS [server](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/)). If you use different pipeline versions, please refer to the table [here](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/display_build_contexts/) to determine what context to use. To learn more about the differences for the pipeline, read the relevant [documentation](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline/jwst-operations-pipeline-build-information#references).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that pipeline software development is a continuous process, so results in some cases may be slightly different if a subsequent version is used. **For optimal results, users are strongly encouraged to reprocess their data using the most recent pipeline version and [associated CRDS context](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/display_build_contexts/), taking advantage of bug fixes and algorithm improvements.** Any [known issues](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/known-issues-with-jwst-data/nirspec-known-issues/nirspec-ifu-known-issues#gsc.tab=0) for this build are noted in the notebook.<br>\n",
