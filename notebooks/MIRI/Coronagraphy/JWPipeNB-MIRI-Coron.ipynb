    "**Purpose**: <br>\n",
    "This notebook provides a framework for processing generic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Coronagraphic data through all three James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) pipeline stages. Data is assumed to be located in separate observation folders according to the paths set up below. Editing cells other than those in the [Configuration](#1.-Configuration) should not be necessary unless the standard pipeline processing options are modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**: <br>\n",
    "This example is set up to use F1550C coronagraphic observations of the super-Jupiter exoplanet HIP 65426 b, obtained by [Program ID](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information) 1386 (PI: S. Hinkley). It incorporates observations of the exoplanet host star HIP 65426 at two separate roll angles (1 exposure each); a PSF reference observation of the nearby star HIP 65219, taken with a 9-pt small grid dither pattern (9 exposures total); a background observation associated with the target star, taken with a 2-pt dither (two exposures); and a background observation associated with the PSF reference target, taken with a 2-pt dither (two exposures). \n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant observation numbers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Science observations: 8, 9<br>\n",
    "- Science backgrounds: 30<br>\n",
    "- Reference observations: 7<br>\n",
    "- Reference backgrounds: 31<br>\n",
