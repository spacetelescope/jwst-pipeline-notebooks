The squared visibilities of both decrease at longer wavelengths due to an effect called bandpass smearing. We expect that calibrating the target by the reference star should correct for this, as well as other systematics."

This model achieves better contrast than ground-based NRM, but has not reached the binary contrast science requirements of AMI. The faint vertical striping in the background of the residual image is 1/f noise (flicker noise), which is an active area of improvement for the NIRISS/AMI team, as is the best method of correcting for charge migration.
