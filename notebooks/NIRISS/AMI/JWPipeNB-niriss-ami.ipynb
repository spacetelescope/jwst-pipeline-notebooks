We plot the squared visibilities against their corresponding baselines (units of meters projected back to the primary meter). We plot the closure phases against the longest of the three baselines that forms the \"closure triangle\" whose phases were summed to calculate the closure phase."

    "The top two scatter plots show the observables from the target observation, and the lower two show the observables from the reference star. For a perfect point source observation at single wavelength, we would expect to recover closure phases of zero and squared visibilites of unity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the closure phases are sensitive to asymmetries in the source brightness distribution, we can tell from the larger scatter of the target that it is likely not a point source; i.e, there is a faint companion. On the other hand, the reference star has closure phases with a much smaller scatter around zero. The squared visibilities of both decrease at longer wavelengths due to an effect called bandpass smearing. We expect that calibrating the target by the reference star should correct for this, as well as other systematics."

    "Each image has been normalized by the peak pixel value of the data, and the data and model are displayed on a square root stretch to emphasize the fainter features. By looking at the residual (data - model) image, we can see that the model is a good fit to the data. This model achieves better contrast than ground-based NRM, but has not reached the binary contrast science requirements of AMI. The faint vertical striping in the background of the residual image is 1/f noise (flicker noise), which is an active area of improvement for the NIRISS/AMI team, as is the best method of correcting for charge migration.
