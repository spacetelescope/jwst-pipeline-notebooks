    "The SOSS sky background is characterized by a smooth rising gradient towards longer wavelengths, with a sharp discontinuity at around X=700 (corresponding to 2.1 $\\mu m$ in Order 1) caused by the edges of the pick-off mirror (POM). The background varies with sky position and relative pointing due to the contribution of zodiacal light. Because of the variation in relative intensity on either side of the discontinuity, an empirical model cannot be simply linearly scaled to match a given observation. However, it is important to remove the background for most SOSS science use cases, so in the absence of a contemporaneous background exposure, the Spec2 `bkg_subtract` step finds the best match for each exposure from a library of empirical models scaled independently on either side of the discontinuity. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the background is considerably lower in the background-subtracted `calints` image compared to the previous `rateints` image, though some residual flux and structure remains. The NIRISS team intends to continue improving the background subtraction algorithm in the future.\n",
