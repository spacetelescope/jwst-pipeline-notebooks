    "# **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a framework for processing generic Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) data through the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) pipeline.  Data is assumed to be located in one observation folder according to paths set up below. It should not be necessary to edit any cells other than in the [Configuration](#1.-Configuration) section unless modifying the standard pipeline processing options. Additional notebooks showing how to optimize and modify sources being extracted for NIRISS WFSS data can be found on the [JDAT notebooks github](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/NIRISS/NIRISS_WFSS_advanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**:\n",
    "This example uses data from the [Program ID 2079](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?program=2079) observation 004 (PI: Finkelstein) observing the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). The observations are in three [NIRISS filters](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-instrumentation/niriss-pupil-and-filter-wheels): F115W, F150W, and F200W use both GR150R and GR150C [grisms](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-instrumentation/niriss-gr150-grisms). In this example we are only looking at data using the F200W filter. A [NIRISS WFSS observation sequence](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-observing-strategies/niriss-wfss-recommended-strategies) typically consists of a direct image followed by a grism observation in the same blocking filter to help identify the sources in the field. In program 2079, the exposure sequence follows the pattern: direct image -> GR150R -> direct image -> GR150C -> direct image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example input data to use will be downloaded automatically unless disabled (i.e., to use local files instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "**JWST pipeline version and CRDS context** This notebook was written for the calibration pipeline version given above. The JWST Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS) context used is associated with the pipeline version as listed [here](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/display_build_contexts/). If you use different pipeline version or CRDS context, please read the relevant release notes ([here for pipeline](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst), [here for CRDS](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/)) for possibly relevant changes.<BR>\n",

In this case, that should match the number of direct images (`FILTER=CLEAR`) in `rate_df` because each direct image is at a unique dither position (XOFFSET, YOFFSET) within an observing sequence. For this program and observation, there is one direct image with only one dither before the grism images, another direct image with four dithers between the change in grisms, and a direct image with three dithers at the end of a blocking filter sequence. This leads to a total of eight images per observing sequence, with five observing sequences in the observation using the blocking filters F115W -> F115W -> F150W -> F150W -> F200W.

    "* [tweakreg](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/tweakreg/README.html) - creates source catalogs of pointlike sources for each input image. The source catalog for each input image is compared to each other to derive coordinate transforms to align the images relative to each other.\n",
    "* As of CRDS context jwst_1156.pmap and later, the pars-tweakreg parameter reference file for NIRISS performs an absolute astrometric correction to GAIA data release 3 by default (i.e., the abs_refcat parameter is set to GAIADR3). Though this default correction generally improves results compared with not doing this alignment, it could potentially result in poor performance in crowded or sparse fields, so users are encouraged to check astrometric accuracy and revisit this step if necessary.\n",
    "* As of pipeline version 1.14.0, the default source finding algorithm for NIRISS is IRAFStarFinder which testing shows returns good accuracy for undersampled NIRISS PSFs at short wavelengths ([Goudfrooij 2022](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/documentation/technical-documents/_documents/JWST-STScI-008324.pdf)).\n",
    "* [skymatch](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/skymatch/description.html) - measures the background level from the sky to use as input into the subsequent outlier detection and resample steps.\n",
    "* outlier detection - flags any remaining cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other artifacts not already flagged during the detector1 stage of the pipeline, using all input images to create a median image so that outliers in individual images can be identified.\n",
    "* [resample](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/resample/main.html) - resamples each input image based on its WCS and distortion information and creates a single undistorted image.\n",
    "* [source catalog](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/source_catalog/main.html) - creates a catalog of detected sources along with measured photometries and morphologies (i.e., point-like vs extended). Useful for quicklooks, but optimization is likely needed for specific science cases, which is an on-going investigation for the NIRISS team. Users may wish to experiment with changing the snr_threshold and deblend options. Modifications to the following parameters will not significantly improve data quality and it is advised to keep them at their default values: aperture_ee1, aperture_ee2, aperture_ee3, ci1_star_threshold, ci2_star_threshold."

    "In NIRISS WFSS data there are many sources of interest to look at. In this visualization we look at, for five selected sources, the source as it appears in the i2d image, two example grism `*_cal.fits` 2-D spectral cutouts, and the level 2 `*_x1d.fits` 1-D extracted spectra for all grism dithers. With the contamination step currently turned off, the contamination can be easily visible when comparing the 1-D and 2-D spectra of the two grisms, especially for source 505 where you can see an order 0 contaminant in the GR150C example `*_cal.fits` image at ~(75, 5), which appears as a large emission line for the GR150C 1-D spectrum.\n",
