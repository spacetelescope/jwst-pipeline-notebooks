    "# **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a framework for processing generic Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) data through the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) pipeline.  Data is assumed to be located in one observation folder according to paths set up below. It should not be necessary to edit any cells other than in the [Configuration](#1.-Configuration) section unless modifying the standard pipeline processing options. Additional notebooks showing how to optimize and modify sources being extracted for NIRISS WFSS data can be found on the [JDAT notebooks github](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/NIRISS/NIRISS_WFSS_advanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**:\n",
    "This example uses data from the [Program ID 2079](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?program=2079) observation 004 (PI: Finkelstein) observing the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). The observations are in three [NIRISS filters](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-instrumentation/niriss-pupil-and-filter-wheels): F115W, F150W, and F200W use both GR150R and GR150C [grisms](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-instrumentation/niriss-gr150-grisms). In this example we are only looking at data using the F200W filter. A [NIRISS WFSS observation sequence](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-observing-strategies/niriss-wfss-recommended-strategies) typically consists of a direct image followed by a grism observation in the same blocking filter to help identify the sources in the field. In program 2079, the exposure sequence follows the pattern: direct image -> GR150R -> direct image -> GR150C -> direct image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example input data to use will be downloaded automatically unless disabled (i.e., to use local files instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "**JWST pipeline version and CRDS context** This notebook was written for the calibration pipeline version given above. The JWST Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS) context used is associated with the pipeline version as listed [here](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/display_build_contexts/). If you use different pipeline version or CRDS context, please read the relevant release notes ([here for pipeline](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst), [here for CRDS](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/)) for possibly relevant changes.<BR>\n",

These `*_rate.fits` products are 2D (nrows x ncols), averaged over all integrations. 3D countrate data products (`*_rateints.fits`) are also created (nintegrations x nrows x ncols) which have the fitted ramp slopes for each integration.\n",

However, it is best to ensure that you are using the same pipeline version as MAST which can be checked in the `CAL_VER` header keyword. \n",

    "In stage1, both the direct images (`EXP_TYPE=NIS_IMAGE`) and dispersed grism images (`EXP_TYPE=NIS_WFSS`) are calibrated. In addition to the `EXP_TYPE` keyword, the keyword `FILTER` can be used to distinguish exposure types for NIRISS WFSS data. `FILTER=CLEAR` indicates a direct image while `FILTER=GR150R` or `FILTER=GR150C` indicates a dispersed image. The keyword `PUPIL` is the blocking filter used in both direct images and dispersed images. We can also use the `PATT_NUM`, `XOFFSET`, and `YOFFSET` header keywords to see the dither pattern that was used for both the direct images and the dispersed images. The multiple direct image dithers will be combined in image3, while the multiple dithers in the dispersed images are combined as individual sources after extraction in spec3. "

    "\n",
    "In this section we continue calibrating the direct images with the Image3 stage of the pipeline to obtain a source catalog and segmentation mapping of the field to use as input into the Spec2 stage later. In the [Image3 stage of the pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_image3.html), the individual `*_cal.fits` files for each of the dither positions are combined to one single distortion corrected image (`*_i2d.fits` files).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the Image3 stage of the pipeline performs the following steps on NIRISS data:\n",
    "* [tweakreg](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/tweakreg/README.html) - creates source catalogs of pointlike sources for each input image. The source catalog for each input image is compared to each other to derive coordinate transforms to align the images relative to each other.\n",
    "* As of CRDS context jwst_1156.pmap and later, the pars-tweakreg parameter reference file for NIRISS performs an absolute astrometric correction to GAIA data release 3 by default (i.e., the abs_refcat parameter is set to GAIADR3). Though this default correction generally improves results compared with not doing this alignment, it could potentially result in poor performance in crowded or sparse fields, so users are encouraged to check astrometric accuracy and revisit this step if necessary.\n",
    "* As of pipeline version 1.14.0, the default source finding algorithm for NIRISS is IRAFStarFinder which testing shows returns good accuracy for undersampled NIRISS PSFs at short wavelengths ([Goudfrooij 2022](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/documentation/technical-documents/_documents/JWST-STScI-008324.pdf)).\n",
    "* [skymatch](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/skymatch/description.html) - measures the background level from the sky to use as input into the subsequent outlier detection and resample steps.\n",
    "* outlier detection - flags any remaining cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other artifacts not already flagged during the detector1 stage of the pipeline, using all input images to create a median image so that outliers in individual images can be identified.\n",
    "* [resample](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/resample/main.html) - resamples each input image based on its WCS and distortion information and creates a single undistorted image.\n",
    "* [source catalog](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/source_catalog/main.html) - creates a catalog of detected sources along with measured photometries and morphologies (i.e., point-like vs extended). Useful for quicklooks, but optimization is likely needed for specific science cases, which is an on-going investigation for the NIRISS team. Users may wish to experiment with changing the snr_threshold and deblend options. Modifications to the following parameters will not significantly improve data quality and it is advised to keep them at their default values: aperture_ee1, aperture_ee2, aperture_ee3, ci1_star_threshold, ci2_star_threshold."

    "After running Image3 and thus getting the the segmentation map and source catalog, the [Spec2 pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_spec2.html#calwebb-spec2) is ready to be run. The spec2 pipeline first runs [assign_wcs](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/assign_wcs/main.html), [background](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/background_subtraction/description.html), and [flat_field](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/flatfield/main.html) corrections first on the full-frame `*_rate.fits` files. The [srctype](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/srctype/description.html) step is run to determine the extent of the extraction box size before the [extract_2d](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/extract_2d/main.html) step is run, producing individual cutouts for the brightest 100 sources defined in the Image3 source catalog. The [wfss_contam](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/wfss_contam/description.html) step is run towards the end of the [extract_2d](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/extract_2d/main.html) step and is currently not on by default as the step is being improved. The [photom](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/photom/main.html) step is then run on the cutouts, producing flux calibrated 2-D spectral (`*_cal.fits`) files. The [extract_1d](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/extract_1d/description.html) step is run last, producing level 2 `*_x1d.fits` files."
