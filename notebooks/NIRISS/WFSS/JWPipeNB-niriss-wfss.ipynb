    "# **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a framework for processing generic Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) data through the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) pipeline. Data from a single proposal and observation ID is assumed to be located in one observation folder according to paths set up below. It should not be necessary to edit any cells other than in the [Configuration](#1.-Configuration) section unless modifying the standard pipeline processing options. Additional notebooks showing how to optimize and modify sources being extracted for NIRISS WFSS data can be found on the [JDAT notebooks github](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/NIRISS/NIRISS_WFSS_advanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**:\n",
    "This example uses data from the [Program ID 2079](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?program=2079) observation 004 (PI: Finkelstein) observing the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). The observations are in three [NIRISS filters](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-instrumentation/niriss-pupil-and-filter-wheels): F115W, F150W, and F200W use both GR150R and GR150C [grisms](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-instrumentation/niriss-gr150-grisms). In this example we are only looking at data from one of the two observations using the F200W filter. A [NIRISS WFSS observation sequence](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-observing-strategies/niriss-wfss-recommended-strategies) typically consists of a direct image followed by a grism observation in the same blocking filter to help identify the sources in the field. In program 2079, the exposure sequence follows the pattern: direct image -> GR150R -> direct image -> GR150C -> direct image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example input data to use will be downloaded automatically unless disabled by the `dodownload` parameter (i.e., to use local files instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "**JWST pipeline version and CRDS context**: \n",
    "This notebook was written for the calibration pipeline version given above. The JWST Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS) context used is associated with the pipeline version as listed [here](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/display_build_contexts/). If you use different pipeline version or CRDS context, please read the relevant release notes ([here for pipeline](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst/releases), [here for CRDS](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/display_context_history/)) for possibly relevant changes. The results of this notebook may differ from the products hosted on the [MAST archive](https://mast.stsci.edu/search/ui/#/jwst) depending on the pipeline version and CRDS context you are using.\n",
    "\n",

In the [Image3 stage of the pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_image3.html), the individual `*_cal.fits` files for each of the dither positions are combined to one single distortion corrected image (`*_i2d.fits` files).\n",

The source catalog for each input image is compared to each other to derive coordinate transforms to align the images relative to each other.\n",
    "* As of CRDS context jwst_1156.pmap and later, the pars-tweakreg parameter reference file for NIRISS performs an absolute astrometric correction to GAIA data release 3 by default (i.e., the abs_refcat parameter is set to GAIADR3). Though this default correction generally improves results compared with not doing this alignment, it could potentially result in poor performance in crowded or sparse fields, so users are encouraged to check astrometric accuracy and revisit this step if necessary.\n",
    "* As of pipeline version 1.14.0, the default source finding algorithm for NIRISS is IRAFStarFinder which testing shows returns good accuracy for undersampled NIRISS PSFs at short wavelengths ([Goudfrooij 2022](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/documentation/technical-documents/_documents/JWST-STScI-008324.pdf)).\n",

    "* outlier detection - flags any remaining cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other artifacts not already flagged during the detector1 stage of the pipeline, using all input images to create a median image so that outliers in individual images can be identified.\n",
    "* [resample](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/resample/main.html) - resamples each input image based on its WCS and distortion information and creates a single undistorted image.\n",
    "* [source catalog](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/source_catalog/main.html) - creates a catalog of detected sources along with measured photometries and morphologies (i.e., point-like vs extended). Useful for quicklooks, but optimization is likely needed for specific science cases, which is an on-going investigation for the NIRISS team.

    "An association file lists the exposures to calibrated together in the Image3 stage of the pipeline. Note that an association file is available for download from MAST, with a filename of `*image3_asn.json`. Additionally, you can download the `_pool.csv` file for a specific observation and create associations directly from the pool file using the [asn_generate](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/associations/asn_generate.html) function with the latest version of the pipeline. In both of these cases, the pipeline is expecting the files being calibrated to exist in the same directory that the association is in. Below, we show how to create an image3 association file by providing a [list of exposures](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/associations/asn_from_list.html) that we have processed through the pipeline and saved in separate directories. Also note that the output products will have a rootname that is specified by the `product_name` in the association file. For this tutorial, the rootname of the output products will end with `image3_asn.json`."

The [wfss_contam](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/wfss_contam/description.html) step is run towards the end of the [extract_2d](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/extract_2d/main.html) step and is currently not on by default as the step is being improved. The [photom](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/photom/main.html) step is then run on the cutouts, producing flux calibrated 2-D spectral (`*_cal.fits`) files. The [extract_1d](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/extract_1d/description.html) step is run last, producing level 2 `*_x1d.fits` files."

    "In Spec2, the `*_rate.fits` files run through various corrections before using the source catalog to extract the 100 brightest sources by default into 1-D spectra (level 2 `*_x1d.fits` files). The parameters in each of the [Spec2 steps](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_spec2.html) can be modified from the default values, including overwriting reference files that are used during this stage and saving additional files. This dictionary of the modified parameters for each of the steps is then fed into the `steps` parameter of the `Spec2Pipeline` call. The syntax for modifying some of these parameters is below. In particular, we show the option of only extracting the 10 brightest sources by setting `wfss_nbright`, as well as showing several options related to the contamination step, including turning on the step, saving the simulated images, and using additional cores to reprocess more quickly. There are several known bugs still with this stage as of pipeline version 1.19.1, so we caution use of this step currently. We also show how to save the background subtracted full-frame file as an intermediate product (*_bsub.fits). These background products are expected to be a default output in an upcoming pipeline build."
