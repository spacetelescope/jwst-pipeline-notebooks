    "**Purpose**:<br>\n",
    "End-to-end calibration with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) pipeline is divided into three main processing stages. This notebook provides a framework for processing generic Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) fixed slit (FS) data through [stages 1-3 of the JWST pipeline](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline/stages-of-jwst-data-processing#gsc.tab=0), including how to use associations for multi-exposure observations and how to interact and work with JWST datamodels. Data is assumed to be organized into three folders: science, background, and associations, as specified in the paths set up below. In most cases, editing cells outside the [Configuration](#1.-Configuration) section is unnecessary unless the standard pipeline processing options or plot parameters need to be modified.\n",

    "This notebook is set up to use observations of Tarantula Nebula with the G140H, G235H, and G395H grisms obtained by Proposal ID (PID) 2729, Observation 5. This observation has a CYCLING dither pattern with 8 points. These observations do not include a nod or background. The demo data will automatically download unless disabled (i.e., to use local files instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "**[JWST pipeline version and CRDS context](#Set-CRDS-Context-and-Server)**:<br>\n",
    "This notebook was written for the above-specified pipeline version and associated build context for this version of the JWST Calibration Pipeline. Information about this and other contexts can be found in the JWST Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS [server](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/)). If you use different pipeline versions, please refer to the table [here](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/display_build_contexts/) to determine what context to use. To learn more about the differences for the pipeline, read the relevant [documentation](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline/jwst-operations-pipeline-build-information#references).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that pipeline software development is a continuous process, so results in some cases may be slightly different if a subsequent version is used. **For optimal results, users are strongly encouraged to reprocess their data using the most recent pipeline version and [associated CRDS context](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/display_build_contexts/), taking advantage of bug fixes and algorithm improvements.**\n",
    "Any [known issues](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/known-issues-with-jwst-data/nirspec-known-issues/nirspec-ifu-known-issues#gsc.tab=0) for this build are noted in the notebook.\n",
